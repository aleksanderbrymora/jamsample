### Overview

What do you do with all those small little loops and riffs and lyrics you've written and recorded but never made the final song cut?? YOU SELL THEM! (note the buying/selling feature didn't make the cut in this project... yet...)

### Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- To pull everything together by building a web application from the ground up.
- To demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far (javascript, html, css, ruby, rails, sql, frameworks, command line, deployment, servers, and much much more...).

### What I've Learned

- **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- **Models**: Created 4 associated models (User, Sample, Collection, Genre).
- **Views.** Used partials to DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
- **Handles invalid data.** Forms in my application validate data and
handle incorrect inputs. Validates sign up information, verifies valid email
addresses and secures passwords.
- **Use Gems** Use a GEM that talks to the cloudinary API to add functionality to the site.
- **User Login.** Basic authentication and authorization set up with error messages to user.
- **Heroku.** Deployed code to Heroku.
- **HTML5 Audio** Utilised the embedded audio functions of HTML5

### Approach Taken

- **Step by Step**: Set up working models and associations with appropriate seed data. Develop user login and authentication, then moved to linking and UX design for user movement across site. User file uploading and styling to finish up.

### Proud as Punch
* **File upload** A two step upload approach for new samples. One page for audio upload, another for image upload.
* **JS / RUBY Interaction** Ability for javascript to access ruby data through controllers and html.
* **Playing with Audio** Utilising the embedded audio library that comes with HTML, and making it work across the site
* **Round and Round** Easy movement through and across site. Simple but effective.

### Bonuses

* **Front-end Framework** Used Twitter Bootstrap to touch up basic front-end styling for navbar and forms in particular.
* **File upload** Utlised Cloudinary API to upload images and audio files.

### Just Missed The Cut

- **Buy/Sell Feature**: Ability for users to buy samples or sell their own samples
- **Further Validation**: Audio and image file validation
- **Profile Image**: For each user/artist
- **Data Dashboard for Admin**: For each user/artist
